# connectplayersapi
backend restful microservice for connect players webapp
maven project

simply checkout project then open as maven project from eclipse/intellij

It's run as a spring boot application.

This project was meant to have a separate frontend with a spring boot backend, but decided to just use jsp and implement it within the 
maven project. The completed project is https://github.com/AchillesRahin/connectwebapp

This one has the same features but a bit behind since that one has been tested and is ready to go. 

This might be revisited to connect with react however the looks like riot might not approve a website dedicated to showing
long history of games played with others so it might be updated to only show between 2 players or just show the winrate
against champions to have better ideas on what to ban.
